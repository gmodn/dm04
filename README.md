# NOTE:
Half-Life Deathmatch is currently on hold due to major changes within s&box. Once s&box becomes more stable, the project will continue.

[Half Life: Deathmatch](https://asset.party/gman/dm04) (Previously known as Deathmatch 2004, or DM04) is a Half-Life-themed Deathmatch experience in S&box. 
This is constantly in development, so any criticism is welcome, just make it constructive, please. 
I want this to be as mapper/developer-friendly as possible, so if there is something that isn't in that you need, let me know and I'll work on it.

# Half-Life Deathmatch is...
